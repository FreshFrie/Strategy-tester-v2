1. [FX_SPOT_FUTURES]
   • Asian session (22:00–07:00 UTC): liquidity traps, pre-London setup, late Asia stop hunts.
   • London open (07:00–08:00 UTC): volatility burst, false breakouts, engineered range breaks, liquidity grabs.
   • London/NY overlap (12:00–15:00 UTC): peak volume/volatility, NY killzone, stop runs, options cut magnet (15:00 UTC), engineered reversals.
   • NY afternoon (15:00–21:00 UTC): post-fix reversals, book squaring, closing stop runs, spread widening, holiday/early close anomalies.
   • Weekend/special (Fri 21:00–Sun 22:00 UTC): gap risk, illiquidity spikes, liquidity vacuum, post-gap reversions.

2. [CME_EQUITY_FUTURES]
   • Overnight (23:00–12:00 UTC): low volume, drift/consolidation, news-driven spikes, cross-asset echo moves.
   • US open (14:30 UTC): volatility burst, stop-driven gap fill, opening range set, engineered sweeps.
   • Midday lull (16:30–18:30 UTC): low volatility, reversal clustering, fade/false breaks.
   • Afternoon/close (18:30–21:00 UTC): trend resumption, late breakouts, closing volatility, manipulation windows (esp. quad witch).
   • Event overlays (FOMC, expiry): volatility/volume surges at fixed macro times.

3. [CRYPTO]
   • 24/7, UTC time cycles; weekdays = high liquidity, weekends = thin/liquidity traps, prone to reversals.
   • Asia/Europe/US overlap (13:00–17:00 UTC): institutional/whale moves.
   • Funding/futures resets (00:00/08:00/16:00 UTC): micro regime changes.
   • Outlier: Sunday night surges, Friday/weekend echo moves, holiday volatility.

4. [OIL/METALS]
   • Asia/Globex open (Sun 22:00 UTC): gap risk, initial range-trap, mean-revert.
   • London morning (07:00–12:00 UTC): fix-driven moves, EU news triggers, engineered stop runs.
   • US session (13:00–18:00 UTC): volatility spikes (e.g. oil EIA Weds 15:30 UTC, NFP), trend extensions, engineered moves.
   • Settlement/close (18:30–19:30 UTC): closing prints, late stop runs, window-dressing, post-settlement air pockets.

5. [ANOMALIES/SPECIAL WINDOWS]
   • Holiday, early close, macro event overlays: engineered volatility, thin liquidity, non-standard traps.
   • Cross-asset event echoes: FX following futures, crypto tracking S&P, etc.
   • Weekend gaps, “vacuum” spikes, post-gap mean-reversion tags.

6. [TAGGING/INTEGRATION]
   • All windows UTC, with EST/local market mapping.
   • Every array tagged with asset, time, volatility regime, typical engineered edge behavior.
   • Ambiguous/rare nodes flagged for micro-DR.

7. [ARCHIVE_STATUS]
   • Timing/edge array complete for live model/alert integration.
   • Modular node structure for expansion, ML, or anomaly overlay.
   • All major event windows, engineered behaviors, and timing anomalies archived.
