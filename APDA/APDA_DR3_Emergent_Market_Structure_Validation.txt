1. [ALGO_UNIFIED-VS-EMERGENT]
   • NO EVIDENCE single IPDA code or centralized program controls global price delivery (regulator, central bank, academic, institutional sweep).
   • Multiple, independent algos (bank/fund EAs, HFTs, central bank tools) synchronize via liquidity logic—emergent, not coordinated.
   • IPDA is a coined pedagogical framework (ICT-origin), not an institutional term or artifact.

2. [ORIGINS/ATTRIBUTION]
   • No patents, tech docs, or leaks align with “IPDA” as a named codebase.
   • All infrastructure algorithms (EBS, CLS, CHIPS) focus on matching, clearing, settlement, not price delivery.
   • All credible attribution points to ICT as author; no insider confirmation of institutional IPDA project.

3. [EMPIRICAL VALIDATION]
   • Stop hunts and liquidity runs: high frequency, mean-reverting, confirmed by academic/industry data.
   • Gap fills: Most small gaps fill quickly; large/fundamental gaps can persist. Not 100%.
   • Cycles (20/40/60): No statistically significant or clockwork cycles; align with seasonality, not strict periodicity.
   • Session patterns: Intraday volatility and “Judas swing” moves confirmed around session opens.
   • Outliers (flash crashes, COVID, oil negative): Explained by exogenous shocks, not algorithmic logic.

4. [UNRESOLVED/EDGE CASES]
   • Cycle failures, permanent gaps, news/fundamental overrides logged as model limitations.
   • Central bank intervention = managed liquidity, not hidden control.
   • Market microstructure mechanisms, objective stop-hunt tagging, cross-asset liquidity flows flagged for next DR.

5. [CROSS-MARKET LOGIC]
   • IPDA-type patterns (liquidity raids, mean reversion, session reversals) observable across FX, indices, crypto, oil—intensity and structure vary by market.

6. [RECOMMENDED_NODES]
   • DR4+: Quant/ML pattern validation, microstructure order flow analysis, cross-market anomaly mapping, dashboarding, adaptive cycle modeling.
   • Tagged all major gaps, flagged for micro-DR follow-up.

7. [ARCHIVE-STATUS]
   • DR3 = Archive-complete, peer-review ready, all ambiguities/gaps open-logged, no rerun required unless new edge emerges.
   • Memory continuity and edge elevation protocol confirmed.
