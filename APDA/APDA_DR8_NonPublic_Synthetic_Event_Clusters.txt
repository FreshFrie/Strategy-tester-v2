—[TAGGING: Asset, UTC time, rarity (σ), source-type]

1. [FX]
   • [Intra-hour Patch Clusters] — 07/13/27/41/53 min past the hour, rare >2σ; microstructure “patching,” technical/AI origin.
   • [10am NY Options Cut] — 15:00 UTC daily; options expiry flows, strike magnet, institutional, frequent but >2.5σ deviations on large expiry days.
   • [4pm London Fix Volatility] — 16:00 UTC (seasonal DST adj.); benchmark flow, engineered volatility bursts, quick reversals; impact varies with order imbalance, not public until event.

2. [CME Equity & Commodity Futures]
   • [Stop-Loss Cascade] — Unscheduled, rare >3σ, HFT-driven, often overnight/early cash; flash crash or spike, domino stop triggers, patch reversal.
   • [End-of-Day Reversal] — 20:00–20:30 UTC, frequent; engineered intraday return reversal, short-cover/risk-off rotation.
   • [Quarterly Roll Anomaly] — March/June/Sep/Dec roll, periodic; basis spreads, volatility spike, synthetic mispricing.

3. [Crypto]
   • [Scamwick Stop-Cascade] — Unpredictable, ultra-rare >4σ, thin order book, isolated exchange event; snap spike + mean reversion (“patch”).
   • [“Bart” Thin-Market Reversal] — 02:00–04:00 UTC, rare >3σ, sharp spike + pause + crash; market maker/AI pattern, low-liquidity induced.
   • [Cross-Market Volatility Alignment] — Routine/frequent; BTC/ETH volatility clusters mirror legacy markets, especially at US close (20:00 UTC), driven by risk flows.

4. [Oil/Metals]
   • [Crude Inventory Release Shock] — Wednesdays 14:30 UTC, frequent >2σ; headline knee-jerk, liquidity vacuum, patch mean-reversion.
   • [Gold Flash Crash/Patch] — Early Asia (01:00–03:00 UTC), rare ~4σ; stop cascade, illiquid hours, “V” recovery, ambiguous cause.

5. [Cross-Asset Echo]
   • [Crypto vs Equities] — US close (20:00 UTC), moderate; volatility echo, risk rebalancing.
   • [FX vs Equities] — Risk-off equity moves lead, FX follows after lag; hidden flow cluster, cross-asset rebalancing.

6. [SOURCE TAGGING]
   • Institutional: option cut, fix, roll, inventory events.
   • Technical/AI: intra-hour microstructure, scamwicks, Bart reversals, stop cascades.
   • Cross-asset: volatility echo, risk-off lag.
   • AI-native/Statistical: flagged where not formally documented, for micro-DR follow-up.

7. [RARITY RATING]
   • Node-graded by observed σ threshold or routine frequency (rare: >3σ, moderate: event-driven/frequent).
   • All anomaly windows flagged for real-time alerting, further micro-DR, or synthetic ML model input.

8. [ARCHIVE_STATUS]
   • Modular cluster array locked for live system or teaching/automation integration.
   • All edge behaviors, asset/time tagging, and rarity ratings complete.
   • Gaps flagged for ongoing statistical validation.
