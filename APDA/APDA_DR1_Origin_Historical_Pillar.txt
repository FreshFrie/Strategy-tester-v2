Type: [Research/Pillar]
 Date: 2025-05-18
 Status: Proven
 Parent: APDA_Root
 Children: All historical/backbone nodes
Definition
Catalog and reconstruct IPDA/APDA: institutional price delivery core theory, historical origin, primary source mapping.


Atomic Workflow
Source trace: FX microstructure, electronic price engine rise (1990s–2000s), EBS/Reuters Matching, dealer algo pricing.


Identify key contributor: Michael J. Huddleston (ICT); “IPDA” as public teaching tool, not institutional code.


Institutional reality: No singular “IPDA,” but algorithmic liquidity-seeking, stop hunt, and scheduled price logic are empirically validated across banks/venues.


Document all unverified, anecdotal, and proprietary claims; flag unverifiable gaps for future DR.


Create master timeline: electronic dealer rise → public smart money teaching → SMC dissemination.


Validation
True if all facts/sources are empirically referenced, falsifiable, and major edge gaps flagged.


False if any claims (origin, code, structure) are left untagged or if timeline is missing.


Meta-Links
Parent: APDA_Root


Children: [DR2_APDA_VERIFICATION], [DR3_APDA_EMERGENT], [DR4_CROSS_ASSET], etc.


QA: Timeline, contributor registry, gap log, source cross-ref, empirical vs. unverified tag.


Examples
IPDA as reverse-engineered framework (ICT, 2012–2025): mapped, not disclosed by banks.


EBS, Reuters, Citi, DB: “proprietary pricing engines,” but no public unified code.


Public edge: stop hunt, liquidity pool, macro time, engineered price logic observed, but as aggregate, not as a “single algorithm.”

Future
Use as root node for all continuity, cross-check, and edge authentication.


Flag all unverifiable/ambiguous claims for further micro-DR or advanced validation.
