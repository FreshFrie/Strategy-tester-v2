1. [MODULE:STOP_HUNT]
   • Inputs: L2/L3 DOM, tape, MBO (if available), key level map.
   • Logic: Detects rapid, high-volume break of swing levels → cascade of executions → snap-back or pause.
   • Output: Visual marker, volume delta, event log, audio/notification.
   • Tier: Bookmap stops add-on (retail); TT/colocation for institutional.

2. [MODULE:ICEBERG_DETECT]
   • Inputs: DOM, tape, MBO order flow.
   • Logic: Volume traded at price > displayed depth; repetitive fills; confirms exhaustion or activation.
   • Output: Chart/tape icon, active iceberg panel, exhaustion alert.
   • Tier: Bookmap/Jigsaw (retail); TT MBO or dark pool tape (institutional).

3. [MODULE:SPOOF_TRAP]
   • Inputs: High-frequency DOM, order add/cancel stream.
   • Logic: Detects sudden large orders that are added and pulled without fill, layering, or moving with price; DOM trap/“mirage” state.
   • Output: Spoofing/DOM trap alert, heatmap/DOM overlay, intensity log.
   • Tier: Jigsaw DOM (retail); direct order event stream for institutional.

4. [MODULE:SESSION_VOL/JUDAS]
   • Inputs: Tick/1m price, volume, session/event calendar.
   • Logic: Detects volatility bursts at open, quantifies initial false move/reversal (Judas swing pattern), tags session inflection.
   • Output: Session timing panel, volatility alerts, swing trap marker.
   • Tier: TradingView/Bookmap chart overlay (retail), TT for cross-asset session alerting.

5. [MODULE:FLASH_CRASH/LATENCY]
   • Inputs: Ultra-low-latency feed, order book, multi-instrument context, system/network time sync.
   • Logic: Flags price drops with no retrace, order book wipe-outs, cross-market/latency anomalies, and sequence breaks.
   • Output: Critical event alert, dashboard banner, API risk signal.
   • Tier: Bookmap sweeps, TT for auto-trading kill-switch.

6. [MODULE:FVG_GAP_REGISTRY]
   • Inputs: Multi-timeframe price data, volume, (optionally order book for fill context).
   • Logic: Detects/records new gaps, maintains pending gap registry, estimates fill probability by context (size, time, volatility).
   • Output: Gap registry dashboard, chart overlays, fill/reminder alerts.
   • Tier: TradingView/Bookmap chart, institutional gap registry (for ML modeling).

7. [GAP_LOGGING/MICRO-DR]
   • All modules record ambiguous/nearly-triggered events, log for review/continuous improvement.
   • Gaps (e.g., partial spoof fills, unconfirmed icebergs, micro-flash moves, session anomalies) are assigned to micro-DR queue for ongoing upgrades.

8. [PLATFORM/ACCESS TAGGING]
   • Each node tagged by: [retail/inst/proprietary], [asset], [timeframe], [tool], [upgrade path].
   • Core system deployable on Bookmap/Jigsaw/TT for advanced retail; full institutional via API, colocation, or direct exchange feeds.

9. [OUTPUT/INTEGRATION]
   • Modular alerts: visual/audio/chart/tape/log/dashboard.
   • Edge logic is designed for immediate extension to live automation (order flow response, risk triggers, ML pattern library).
   • API/export-ready for real-time onboarding, legacy archiving, or AI signal training.
