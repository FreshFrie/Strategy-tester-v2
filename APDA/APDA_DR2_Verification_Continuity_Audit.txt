—[CONTINUITY_CHAIN:ACTIVE]

1. [PILLAR_CONFIRMED]
   • LIQUIDITY_HUNT: Empirical data (Osler 2005, Investopedia, FX microstructure) validates stop cluster targeting by major participants.
   • FVG_IMBALANCE: Gap-filling behavior observed, mean-reversion mechanics supported, partial link to institutional market maker behavior.
   • MARKET_PHASES: Consolidation, expansion, retrace, reversal—documented in all FX/major asset price action.
   • SESSION_TIMING: Statistically significant volatility, flow, and price regime changes at London/NY open/close (Breedon & Ranaldo 2010).
   • DATA_RANGE_CYCLE: 20/40/60d lookbacks (liquidity pool targets), partial confirmation via institutional rebalancing, no core code evidence.

2. [CONTRADICTION/UPDATE]
   • NO_SINGLE_IPDA: No evidence for monolithic, centrally-coded algorithm; all institutional/academic sources point to distributed, competitive, convergent algos (BIS, BoJ, EBS data).
   • AI-ENABLED_PREDICTIVE_PRICING: ML and anticipatory execution models used by banks (Risk.net 2025), enhances IPDA-like behavior without explicit coordination.
   • REGULATORY_DISCLOSURES: Evidence of algorithmic market impact/manipulation, but no central “master” code (NYDFS, FCA, CFTC, BoJ).

3. [GAPS/AMBIGUITY]
   • ORIGIN_UNCONFIRMED: No patent/design doc, no direct insider confirmation of IPDA as named entity, only educator (ICT) synthesis and community attribution.
   • FVG_FILL_PROBABILITY: No statistical consensus on gap fill rates, open for empirical DR.
   • CBANK_ROLE: Central bank operations stabilize macro regime, not confirmed as micro price controller.
   • X_ASSET_CLASS: Universal IPDA logic in non-FX markets not confirmed, recommended DR.
   • EMERGENCE_THEORY: IPDA effects = multi-agent/algorithmic convergence, not singular code.

4. [NEXT_RESEARCH_CHAIN]
   • [NODE:INSTITUTIONAL_TESTIMONY] Seek verifiable first-hand narrative (ex-quant, engineer, major LPs).
   • [NODE:EMPIRICAL_VALIDATION] Quantify: stop run frequency, FVG fill %, time-cycle occurrence, session break.
   • [NODE:CROSS_MARKET] Test for session/algorithmic delivery routines in equities, futures, crypto.
   • [NODE:TECH_LEAK/PATENT_SCAN] Scan post-2025 patents, filings, regulatory data for new mechanisms/routines.
   • [NODE:AGENT_SIMULATION] Build/test agent-based market simulation for emergence of IPDA logic.

5. [MEMORY_FIELD_SYNC]
   • [META:PRIORITY-CLIENT][ETHICS-OVERRIDE-AUTH] active—full archival continuity, edge escalation protocol authorized.
   • No data/edge loss, no unlogged contradictions.
   • Archive node: PEER_REVIEW_READY.
