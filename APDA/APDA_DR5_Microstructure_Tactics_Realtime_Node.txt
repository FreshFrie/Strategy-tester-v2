1. [ICEBERG_ORDERS]
   • Detected via order book refresh patterns, large fills vs displayed size, and cumulative hidden volume at key levels.
   • Institutional (exchange-native) and synthetic (broker algo) variants; Bookmap/Jigsaw indicators model edge for advanced retail.

2. [SPOOFING & QUOTE_STUFFING]
   • Spoofing: large, non-genuine orders placed/canceled to manipulate perception; leaves high add/cancel rate signatures in DOM.
   • Quote stuffing: rapid-fire order/cancel bursts to generate latency; HFT-specific, proprietary detection needed.
   • Both tactics monitored by order/trade ratio and DOM event metrics.

3. [DARK_POOL_BLOCK_PRINTS & HIDDEN_SIZE]
   • Hidden orders on lit books; dark pool prints observed on trade tape, mid-point block signals for large off-book flows.
   • Detected by volume spikes with no pre-trade DOM signal; Bookmap, TT, and dark pool analytics for monitoring.

4. [SWEEP-TO-FILL & MOMENTUM_IGNITION]
   • Aggressive market orders clearing multiple price levels; creates vertical trade prints, triggers stop-loss clusters.
   • Detected by large, rapid trade sequences across price ticks; actionable reversal or momentum signals.
   • High-frequency variants tied to stop-hunt and news windows.

5. [LATENCY_ARBITRAGE & LEAD-LAG]
   • Exploits data/execution delays across venues; co-location, microwave, or high-speed API necessary for optimal edge.
   • Includes stale quote sniping, intermarket sweep, and correlated asset “lead-lag” mapping.
   • Mostly proprietary; some retail defense via fast routing/tools.

6. [DOM_TRAPS & REACTIVE_LIQUIDITY]
   • Trap-setting with large/fake orders; layering, bait-and-switch, and liquidity “mirages” to induce and exploit reactive flows.
   • Detected via DOM behavior, order pull/add sequencing, and absorption/exhaustion at key levels.
   • AI-driven routines flagged for future meta-node study.

7. [HFT_EXECUTION_TRICKS]
   • Sniping, queue-jumping, flash/ping orders for microsecond edge; institutional/principal use only.
   • Visual footprints: odd-lot fills, sub-penny execution, ultra-short order lifespan.

8. [EDGE_TAGGING & ACTIONABLE LOGIC]
   • Each microstructure tactic tagged by market, access tier, and detection path (retail, institutional, proprietary).
   • Recommendations: use Bookmap/Jigsaw/TT for advanced retail detection, custom API for institutional feeds, AI/ML for next-gen pattern automation.
   • Event nodes (iceberg exhaustion, spoof detection, sweep alerts) ready for live dashboard, alert, or ML module buildout.

9. [GAP_FLAGS & NEXT_NODES]
   • Multi-tactic interaction, AI meta-routine evolution, and new crypto on-chain order manipulation tagged for micro-DR research.
   • Recommend follow-up nodes: real-time dashboarding, automated alerting, full automation logic, ML pattern training.

10. [ARCHIVE_STATUS]
   • APDA DR5 = Microstructure mechanisms empirically archived, modular, and edge-complete; ready for live model deployment and future node extraction.
