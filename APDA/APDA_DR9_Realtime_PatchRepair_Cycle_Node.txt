1. [Intra-Hour Mean Reversion Patch]
   • Assets: FX majors, equity futures, oil
   • Timing: ~07/13/27/41/53 min past hour (UTC)
   • Behavior: Microstructure-driven mean-reversion after time-based price drift; cyclic liquidity refresh/algos/inventory balancing
   • Detection: Price >1σ from 15-min mean at these marks, momentum stall/order book rebuild, fade triggers
   • Resolution: Snap-back to mean/VWAP, confirmation on cross-back or 50% retrace
   • Edge: Scalping, systematic reversion, frequent intraday event

2. [Sentiment Unwind/Behavioral Patch]
   • Assets: All, esp. retail/crypto, indices, metals
   • Timing: Post false breakout, FOMO/panic moves; no fixed clock
   • Behavior: Psychological reversal; emotional spike with no follow-through, then mean-revert as crowd fades
   • Detection: Breakout + high volume + wick, then reversal below/above break; momentum roll, delta flip
   • Resolution: Full/partial return to pre-breakout range, engulfing bar, volatility normalization
   • Edge: Fade false breakouts; high reward reversals, resets rational price

3. [Microstructure Repair Cycle (Post-Stop Cascade)]
   • Assets: FX, S&P/Nasdaq futures, crypto
   • Timing: Event-driven, post stop-run/flash move (esp. off-peak)
   • Behavior: Liquidity vacuum/stop chain, followed by order book refilling, absorption, V reversal
   • Detection: >2–3σ spike/wick, sudden volume, bid/ask void, immediate absorption
   • Resolution: V-shape rally, price reclaim of broken level/VWAP, sustained reversion, reestablish range
   • Edge: Fade overshoot, ride mean-reversion, repair liquidity

4. [Event-Driven Patch (News/Volatility)]
   • Assets: All; esp. FX, futures, oil, metals
   • Timing: Scheduled news (CPI, NFP, FOMC, EIA oil); top or half hour
   • Behavior: News spike/overshoot (algo-driven), knee-jerk volatility, followed by rational reversion
   • Detection: Massive bar at event, no follow-through, price returns to news open/midpoint, volatility/IV collapse
   • Resolution: Price closes past spike origin, band re-cross, volatility drop, risk reset
   • Edge: Fade post-news overshoot, volatility normalization

5. [Archival/Retrospective Mining]
   • Structured archive: Patch events logged with UTC, asset, patch type, anomaly magnitude, resolution
   • Training set for ML: Outcome-tagged for precursors, efficacy, model refinement
   • Feedback: Real-time alerts feed archive, inform detection upgrades, adaptive loop

6. [TAGGING/SOURCE]
   • Patch type: [microstructure], [behavioral], [event]
   • Asset/time/duration tagging, recurrence by event frequency/statistics
   • All logic ready for live alerting, automation, and continuous learning

7. [ARCHIVE_STATUS]
   • Node library locked, legacy/teaching/automation ready, micro-DR flagged for evolving patterns
